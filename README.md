# knn-classification

In this project, I build a classifier that guesses a movieâ€™s genre by training data from the IMDB screenplay
dataset, using k-nearest neighbors. This was a project I worked on in one of my classes during undergrad and I am hoping to increase its accuracy soon.

General outline of the project:
1. From available data, select test and training sets.
2. Choose an algorithm that will be used for classification.
3. Identify some features.
4. Define a classifier function using features and the training set.
5. Evaluate its performance (the proportion of correct classifications) on the test set.
